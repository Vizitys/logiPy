# LogiPy

This is a simple adaptation of the [`logipy`](https://github.com/Logitech/logiPy) package. The following notable changes have been made:

- There is no longer an arx module. It has been almost 5 years since the arx app on iOS has been updated.
- The LED module now also works with the new G Hub software. Please look into the installation section on how to use this library.

## Installation

1. Install [Logitech G Hub](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html).
2. Make sure that the installation is somewhere the library can find it. You can also provide the library with a path to your G Hub installation.
3. Install the library. TODO: Publish to PyPI for easy installation.
